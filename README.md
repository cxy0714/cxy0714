## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Xingyu Chen(é™ˆæ˜Ÿå®‡), a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Default/index/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), now interested in causal inference, higher order influence function, bootstrap and statistical computing. My advisor is [Professor Lin Liu (åˆ˜æž—)](https://linliu-stats.github.io/). 

Before joining SJTU, I received my B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://maths.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST)](http://www.hust.edu.cn/). 

âš¡ Fun fact: "0714" is the discipline code for Statistics in Chinese Ministry of Education's subject classification system, where "07" represents Science and "0701" represents Mathematics. ([Source](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn/Public/Upload/ma_pyfa/8/1724397240_1234597415.pdf))
